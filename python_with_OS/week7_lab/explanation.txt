 this is the reference to explain <dictionary.setdefault(keyname, value)>

The setdefault() method returns the value of the item with the specified key.  

https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_setdefault.asp

the error_pattern extracts the line into groups:
group(1) is the error message, group(2) is the user name. (group(0) is the whole sentence by default)

2. info_pattern extracts only the user name in that line.

3. the error_msg dictionary is looked like {key = error msg, value = count}

error_msg.setdefault(extracts.group(1),0) : if the error message doesn't exist, give 0 as the default value to this key(hints the error msg).  otherwise, no effect.

error_msg[extracts.group(1)]+=1: increase by 1 of the value(hints the count of the appearance of the error msg) when we see the specified error message 

4. the user_stat dictionary is looked like {key = username, value=[info, error]}, the value of this dictionary is a list. the index of "info" of the value list is 0, index error is 1. 

user_stat.setdefault(extracts.group(2),[0,0])[1]+=1:could be saw like this:

  user_stat.setdefault(username,[info,error])[error]+=1

(set {key = username, value = [0,0]} as default, increase the error count by 1 of this key)

user_stat.setdefault(extracts.group(1),[0,0])[0]+=1:could be saw like this:

user_stat.setdefault(username,[info,error])[info]+=1

(set {key = username, value = [0,0]} as default, increase the info count by 1 of this key)

em... I donâ€™t know if my explanation is clear enough. if you understand the index of list/dictionary and setdefault() method, it's not hard to figure it out. :)
